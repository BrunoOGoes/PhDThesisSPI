# The theory of spin photon interfaces

This repository is dedicated to the comprehensive collection of codes utilized to generate the plots and/or analytical expressions showcased within the pages of my PhD thesis.


[Quantum measurements](Chapter1)

In this chapter I discuss the von Neumann measurement model. With the aid of a simple toy-model where we have a target system with an arbitrary spin interacting with a single bosonic mode. It introduces several important concepts such as target and meter system, pre-measurement, collapse, and the figures of merit used to benchmark the steps of the measurement.
