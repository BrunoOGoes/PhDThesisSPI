# The theory of spin photon interfaces

This repository is dedicated to the comprehensive collection of codes utilized to generate the plots and/or analytical expressions showcased within the pages of my PhD thesis.


[Chapter 1: Quantum measurements](Chapter1)

In this chapter I discuss the von Neumann measurement model. With the aid of a simple toy-model where we have a target system with an arbitrary spin interacting with a single bosonic mode. It introduces several important concepts such as target and meter system, pre-measurement, collapse, and the figures of merit used to benchmark the steps of the measurement.

[Chapter 2: Collisional model for a qubit interaction with a multimode waveguide](Chapter2)

In this chapter, we provide a comprehensive review and detailed analysis of the findings presented in Ref. [Entropy 2022, 24(2), 151](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/24/2/151). These results serve as the foundation for the subsequent investigations conducted in Refs. [arXiv:2205.09623](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09623) and [Phys. Rev. A 107, 023710](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.107.023710), as well as the forthcoming chapters of this thesis. Our focus is on the closed dynamics of a two-level system, also referred to as a 2LS or qubit, interacting with a field. Through solving this interaction, we derive analytical expressions for the joint wave function of the qubit and the field under two specific initial states: a coherent state and a single photon.

[Chapter 3: Quantum weak values and Wigner negativity in a single qubit gate](Chapter3)

This chapter is based on the results published in [Phys. Rev. A 107, 023710](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.107.023710). Our findings highlight an intriguing phenomenon: when a qubit interacts with a strong resonant coherent field, alongside post-selection, we observe the emergence of anomalous weak values for the field's excitations. Additionally, we discover that the associated field state exhibits Wigner function negativity, adding further intrigue to this exciting study.

[Chapter 4: The spin-photon interface](Chapter4)



[Chapter 5: Proposal and error analysis for a photon-photon gate](Chapter5)

We propose an ideal protocol for implementing a photon-photon controlled phase gate in the monochromatic regime. We introduce a parameter to quantify the deviation of the scattered field from the desired state, which serves as the main source of error. The gate expressions are derived based on this parameter. Additionally, we perform an error analysis by evaluating the fidelity and error process matrix, providing definitions and discussions for these concepts.
