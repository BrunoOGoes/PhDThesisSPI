# The theory of spin photon interfaces

This repository is dedicated to the comprehensive collection of codes utilized to generate the plots and/or analytical expressions showcased within the pages of my PhD thesis.


[Chapter 1: Quantum measurements](Chapter1)

In this chapter I discuss the von Neumann measurement model. With the aid of a simple toy-model where we have a target system with an arbitrary spin interacting with a single bosonic mode. It introduces several important concepts such as target and meter system, pre-measurement, collapse, and the figures of merit used to benchmark the steps of the measurement.

[Chapter 2: Chapter 2 Collisional model for a qubit interaction with a multimode waveguide](Chapter2)

In this chapter, we provide a comprehensive review and detailed analysis of the findings presented in Ref. [Entropy 2022, 24(2), 151](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/24/2/151). These results serve as the foundation for the subsequent investigations conducted in Refs. [arXiv:2205.09623](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09623) and [Phys. Rev. A 107, 023710](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.107.023710), as well as the forthcoming chapters of this thesis. Our focus is on the closed dynamics of a two-level system, also referred to as a 2LS or qubit, interacting with a field. Through solving this interaction, we derive analytical expressions for the joint wave function of the qubit and the field under two specific initial states: a coherent state and a single photon.
